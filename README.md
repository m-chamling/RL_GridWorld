# GridWorld Q-Learning Agent

This project is a simple reinforcement learning agent trained using Q-learning in a custom 5x5 GridWorld environment.

## Features
- Custom-built GridWorld environment
- Q-Learning algorithm
- Reward plot visualization
- Learned policy shown as a grid of arrows
- Test path demonstration

## Files
- `gridworld.py` – main RL code

## Running the Agent
